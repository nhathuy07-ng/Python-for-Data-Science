## Core concepts

### Arrays
- **Series**: 1D Array
- **Dataframe**:
  + Equivalent to 2D Array, or an Excel Spreadsheet.
  + Two axis: rows and columns (also called **series**)
    + Index starts at 0 and runs along columns.
    + **Feature**: a column
    + **Observation**: a row
    + **Value**: intersection between row and column
    + Each feature ONLY holds one data type. 

### Attributes

- Referenced by name using dotted expression (i.e `df.columns`)

### Function

### Methods
